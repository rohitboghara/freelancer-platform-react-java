# Freelancer Platform (React + Java)

> **Animated README** ‚Äî visually rich README tailored for the `freelancer-platform-react-java` repository. It includes an animated SVG header, demo GIF placeholders, animations guidance, setup instructions, and contributor notes.

---

## üî• Quick overview

A full-stack Freelancer marketplace application with:

* **Frontend:** React (looks under `frontend/`) ‚Äî user / client / freelancer UI, job listings, proposals, chat, dashboard.
* **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot) (under `backend/`) ‚Äî REST APIs, authentication, job & proposal management, persistence.
* **Databases:** DB configs under `databases/` (MySQL / PostgreSQL / scripts).
* **Docker Compose:** `docker-compose.yml` for local development containers.

> No top-level `README` was present ‚Äî this file is made to be dropped in the repository root.

---

## üéØ Features (suggested / inferred)

* User authentication (sign up / login)
* Roles: Client, Freelancer, Admin
* Post jobs, submit proposals
* Bid management & hiring flow
* Profile pages & portfolios
* Basic messaging between client & freelancer
* File uploads for proposals / portfolios

*(If any of these aren't implemented yet, update the Features section below to match actual functionality.)*

## ‚ñ∂ Demo / Animated Preview

> Add an animated GIF or MP4 demo to the repository at `frontend/assets/demo.gif` (or `README_assets/demo.gif`) and then use the example below to show it here.

```md
![App demo](assets/demo.gif)
```

### Example animated SVG badge (already in header)

The header above is an inline animated SVG. GitHub renders SVG images ‚Äî an inline `data:` SVG works well for small decorations (as used at the top). If you prefer a GIF, export a short screen-recording and place it under `frontend/public/assets/` or `README_assets/`.

---

## üöÄ Installation (Local)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (16+ recommended)
* npm or yarn
* Java 17+ (or project-required JDK)
* Maven or Gradle (if backend uses Maven, `pom.xml` should be in backend)
* Docker & docker-compose (optional, recommended for easy set up)

### 1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rootadmin12321/freelancer-platform-react-java.git
cd freelancer-platform-react-java
```

### 2) Start with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
# bring up all services (backend, frontend, dbs) if docker-compose is configured
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3) Or run services individually

**Backend (Spring Boot)**

```bash
cd backend
# if Maven
mvn clean spring-boot:run
# or build then run
mvn package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

**Frontend (React)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# or if yarn
# yarn
# yarn start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:8080` (backend), adjust ports if different.

---

## üß© Environment variables

Create `.env` (or `application.properties`) files as required by each service. Example keys you may need:

**backend:**

```
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql-db:3306/freelancerdb
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=root
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

**frontend:**

```
VITE_API_URL:http://localhost:3031
```

```

## üí° Tips for making the README fully animated & delightful

1. **Animated GIFs** ‚Äî Record short clips (5‚Äì12s) of the UI and include under `README_assets/demo.gif`.
2. **SVG data-URIs** ‚Äî Small badges/headers can be inline SVG data-URIs (as used here). They're tiny and animate smoothly.
3. **Lottie animations** ‚Äî Add Lottie JSON and show a *preview GIF* in README (GitHub doesn't render Lottie). You can host the Lottie player in the app itself.
4. **Animated badges** ‚Äî Use shields (badges) with changing text or use animated GIF badges hosted in the repo.
5. **Screenshots carousel** ‚Äî Add several GIFs and show them as separate images in README; GitHub will stack them nicely.

## üß™ Running tests

If the repo has tests, show how to run them. Example:

```bash
# backend
cd backend
mvn test

# frontend
cd frontend
npm test
```

---


## üì¶ Docker

If `docker-compose.yml` exists (it does), ensure the services match the folder names. Example run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To run only backend:

```bash
docker-compose up backend
```

2. Create a feature branch `git checkout -b feat/animated-readme`
3. Commit your changes and push
4. Create a Pull Request describing the change

Please include demo GIFs for any UI changes so the README can show the animation.

## ‚úÖ What's included in this README you can use right away

* Animated SVG header (top of this README)
* Sections: Overview, Features, Installation, Environment, Docker, Run, Contributing
* Placeholders and example snippets to embed GIFs

---

If you'd like, I can:

* Generate demo GIFs from a short screen recording (you'd have to provide the recording), or
* Create a ready-to-commit `README.md` and a small `README_assets/demo.gif` placeholder and show you the exact `git` commands to add & push it.

Tell me if you want me to commit the README to the repo (I can prepare the exact `git` commands or a patch you can apply).
